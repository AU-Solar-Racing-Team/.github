# About

The Adelaide University Solar Racing Team competes in the Bridgestone
World Solar Car Challenge, racing from Darwin to Adelaide in a car powered
by only the sun.

# Getting Started with GitHub

AUSRT uses GitHub as a place to collaborate with the team, manage code and
keep a version controlled history of development.

If you think that you need access to GitHub, please contact David Sutton
either via Teams or Email (david.a.sutton@student.adelaide.edu.au).

If you need any more assistance with using git or GitHub, please feel free to
ask questions, and people will be happy to help.
